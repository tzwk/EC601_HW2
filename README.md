An Android application
The Trello page:
https://trello.com/b/ixdDG2Bb/ec601hw2

The first part is the example code programmed based on the tutorials on the android website 
(https://developer.android.com/training/index.html) Video see "part 1.mp4".

The second part is to add password log in feature in the app

Due to the problem of the website or player settings, the mp4 video files may be corrupted when open it, to solve the problem, right click on the "view raw" button and choose "save link as" option, then you can play it in your "Downloads" folder. Sorry for the inconvenience.
